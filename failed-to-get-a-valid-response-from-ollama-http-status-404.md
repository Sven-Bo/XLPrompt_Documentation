# Failed to get a valid response from Ollama (HTTP Status: 404)

If you see this error:

**`Failed to get a valid response from Ollama. (HTTP Status: 404 - Server message: {"error":"model \"gemma3:1b\" not found, try pulling it first"})`**

…it means that the model you're trying to use is not installed on your machine.

***

**✅ Step 1: Check the Model in Settings**

1. Open Excel and go to the **XLlama** tab.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Under **Model Name**, use the dropdown to select one of the models _already installed_ on your machine.

If the dropdown is empty or you don’t see the model you want — keep reading.

**✅ Step 2: Install the Model**

You can install more models by clicking the **Install More Models** link in the Settings window.

Or you can directly navigate to [**THIS**](how-to-install-more-ollama-models.md) page, which explains how to install a specific model on your machine.

After that, go back to Excel, open **Settings**, and you should now see your new model in the dropdown.\
Select it — and then try running XLlama again.
