### Step 1: Unzip the File

After downloading, make sure the `.zip` file is unzipped. Safari often does this automatically. If not, double-click it to unzip. You should now see a file named:\
`XLlama.xlam`

### Step 2: Move It to the Add-Ins Folder

Now move the file from your **Downloads** folder to Excelâ€™s official Add-Ins folder:\
`/Users/YourName/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/User Content/Add-Ins`

To get there:

1. Open **Finder**
2. In the top menu, click **Go**
3. Hold the **Option** key â€” now click **Library**
4. Go to:\
   `Group Containers > UBF8T346G9.Office > User Content > Add-Ins`
5. Copy or drag the `XLlama.xlam` file into this folder

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: With that folder open, press `Command + Control + T` to bookmark it in your sidebar for easier access next time.

### Step 3: Load It in Excel

1. Open Excel
2. Go to **Tools > Excel Add-insâ€¦**
3. If `XLlama.xlam` is listed, check the box and click **OK**
4. If not listed, click **Browse**, navigate to the Add-Ins folder, select `XLlama.xlam`, then click **OK**

Thatâ€™s it. Excel will now load XLlama every time it starts.

### How to Uninstall

Go to **Tools > Excel Add-insâ€¦**, uncheck `XLlama`, and click **OK**.\
The file will stay in the list in case you want to re-enable it later.
